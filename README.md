# workshop_ML
This project is a Flask application which is used to predict the price of cars based on the curb-weight. The prediction models used are Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression. The models were built using Jupyter Notebook with Numpy and Pandas libraries. 

The application can be used to input a curb-weight and get the predicted price of the car. The application also uses a graphical user interface to provide a visual representation of the regression models used.

To use the application, simply run the main.py file and the application will start. This will open a web page where you can input the curb-weight and get the predicted price.

This project provides an easy way to predict the price of cars based on their curb-weight. The models used are reliable and accurate and the application is easy to use.
